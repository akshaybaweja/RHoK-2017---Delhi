        <h1>U B E R Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>For an app I'm building for myself, I have to provide a privacy policy for data retrieved from the API.<br>
            I will not release any data from the Uber API without explicit and clear consent of the user. <br>
            This does not affect the user's statutory rights. <br>
            The user is able to stop using the service at any time,<br>
            and can remove any data from the service using the appropriate database management commands.
